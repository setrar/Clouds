# OpenTofu

**OpenTofu** can be installed via **Homebrew** on macOS, as it is supported in the Homebrew package manager.

### Steps to Install OpenTofu with Homebrew
1. **Ensure Homebrew is Installed:**
   If you don't already have Homebrew, install it by running:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Add the OpenTofu Tap:**
   OpenTofu might not be in the main Homebrew repository, so you may need to add its tap:
   ```bash
   brew tap opentofu/tap
   ```

3. **Install OpenTofu:**
   Once the tap is added, install OpenTofu:
   ```bash
   brew install opentofu
   ```

4. **Verify the Installation:**
   Confirm that OpenTofu is installed and accessible:
   ```bash
   tofu --version
   ```

   If installed correctly, this will display the version of OpenTofu.

5. **Keep OpenTofu Updated:**
   To update OpenTofu in the future, use:
   ```bash
   brew update
   brew upgrade opentofu
   ```

If OpenTofu is not available directly in Homebrew or the tap, you can download the binary from the [OpenTofu GitHub releases page](https://github.com/opentofu) and place it in a directory in your `$PATH`.
