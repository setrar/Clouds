#  **OpenTofu** with the **Azure CLI**

To use **OpenTofu** with the **Azure CLI**, you can follow these steps to integrate both tools effectively for provisioning and managing Azure resources.

---

### Prerequisites
1. **Install OpenTofu:**
   Install OpenTofu using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install opentofu
   ```

2. **Install Azure CLI:**
   Ensure the Azure CLI is installed:
   ```bash
   brew install azure-cli
   ```
   Verify installation:
   ```bash
   az --version
   ```

3. **Authenticate Azure CLI:**
   Log in to Azure using the Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```
   This will open a browser window for authentication. Once logged in, your credentials will be stored locally for use by OpenTofu.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Use OpenTofu with Azure CLI

#### 1. **Configure OpenTofu for Azure**
OpenTofu uses the **Azure provider** to interact with Azure services. Add the Azure provider configuration to your `main.tf` file:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

#### 2. **Create an OpenTofu Configuration File**
Hereâ€™s an example configuration file to deploy an Azure resource group and a virtual machine:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
  name                  = "example-vm"
  location              = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  vm_size               = "Standard_B2s"

  storage_image_reference {
    publisher = "Canonical"
    offer     = "UbuntuServer"
    sku       = "18.04-LTS"
    version   = "latest"
  }

  storage_os_disk {
    name              = "example-os-disk"
    caching           = "ReadWrite"
    create_option     = "FromImage"
    managed_disk_type = "Standard_LRS"
  }

  os_profile {
    computer_name  = "example-vm"
    admin_username = "azureuser"
    admin_password = "P@ssw0rd123!"
  }

  os_profile_linux_config {
    disable_password_authentication = false
  }

  network_interface_ids = [
    azurerm_network_interface.example.id,
  ]
}

resource "azurerm_network_interface" "example" {
  name                = "example-nic"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "internal"
    subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.example.id
    private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
  name                 = "example-subnet"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]
}
```

#### 3. **Run OpenTofu Commands**
1. **Initialize the Configuration:**
   ```bash
   tofu init
   ```
   > Returns
   ```powershell
      
   Initializing the backend...
   
   Initializing provider plugins...
   - Finding latest version of hashicorp/azurerm...
   - Installing hashicorp/azurerm v4.15.0...
   - Installed hashicorp/azurerm v4.15.0 (signed, key ID 0C0AF313E5FD9F80)
   
   Providers are signed by their developers.
   If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
   https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/plugins/signing/
   
   OpenTofu has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
   selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
   so that OpenTofu can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
   you run "tofu init" in the future.
   
   OpenTofu has been successfully initialized!
   
   You may now begin working with OpenTofu. Try running "tofu plan" to see
   any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All OpenTofu commands
   should now work.
   
   If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for OpenTofu,
   rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
   commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   ```
   This downloads the required Azure provider plugins.

2. **Preview the Changes:**
   ```bash
   tofu plan
   ```
   This shows the resources that will be created.

3. **Apply the Configuration:**
   ```bash
   tofu apply
   ```
   Type `yes` when prompted to create the resources.

4. **Verify the Deployment:**
   Use the Azure CLI to check the resources created:
   ```bash
   az group list --output table
   az vm list --output table
   ```

---

### 4. **Managing Resources**
- **Update Resources:**
  Modify the `main.tf` file and run:
  ```bash
  tofu plan
  tofu apply
  ```

- **Destroy Resources:**
  To remove all resources managed by OpenTofu:
  ```bash
  tofu destroy
  ```

---

### 5. **Best Practices**
- **Use Azure CLI for Authentication:**
  By default, the Azure provider in OpenTofu uses the credentials from `az login`.
  
- **Store Secrets Securely:**
  Use Azure Key Vault or environment variables to manage sensitive data like passwords or keys.

- **Integrate Monitoring:**
  Combine Azure Monitor with OpenTofu deployments to keep track of resource performance and logs.
