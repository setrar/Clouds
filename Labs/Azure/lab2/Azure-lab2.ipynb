    "1. We saw how to do numerical integration in the class. You first task is to create a program that can\n",
    "do numerical integration with the function abs(sin(x)). Given an interval lower and upper, your code\n",
    "should break up the interval into $N$ subintervals, compute the area of the rectangle at each\n",
    "subinterval and add them all up. For example, if you give as input 0 and 3.14159 (which is\n",
    "approximately $\\pi$), you should get $1.99‚Ä¶$ which is close to $2$ ($\\int \\sin ùë• = ‚àí \\cos ùë•$, ignoring aspects of\n",
    "continuity, which when evaluated in the range gives you $- \\cos \\pi + \\cos 0 = 2$). Your program should\n",
    "loop and repeatedly compute numerical integral for $N = 10, 100, 100, 1000, 10k, 100k, 1M$. You will\n",

    "converges to 2.This will also make the integral computation time consuming which will be useful for\n",
    "load testing later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now take the python program from above and convert it into a microservice. Read section 19.1 if\n",
    "you want to know what a microservice is if you have not read it already. You can use any\n",
    "framework you want (python (flask), javascript (nodejs), C# (.net)). I recommend python & flask.\n",
    "The microservice, when run, will take the lower and upper as arguments. These could be URL\n",
    "route or parameters (http://localhost:5000/numericalintegralservice/0/3.14159). What you are\n",
    "doing is instead of invoking the program via python interpreter, you are invoking it via a HTTP\n",
    "call.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test your microservice locally on your computer. If you cant use a local computer, you can get a\n",
    "VM from Azure and do your development there. Use curl or a browser to verify that it works.\n",
    "Next, load test your microservice with Locust (https://locust.io/). The goal is to create many\n",
    "clients that all invoke the service over HTTP simulatenously. Test with 1 client. If it works, test\n",
    "with multiple clients. Here‚Äôs a reference guide to run locust without a UI1\n",
    "(https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/running-without-web-ui.html#running-without-web-ui). You can\n",

    "performance. You will use the output to plot a graph later.**"
